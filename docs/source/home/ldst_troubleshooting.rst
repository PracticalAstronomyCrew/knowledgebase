    - Baud Rate: 115200

Alignment in SkyX slightly off after slew
-----------------------------------------

.. note:: Star Choice

  - Find a star between the pole and horizon, but not too close to either.
  - If your star isn´t working, after a few tries, try another suitable one far from the first.

.. note:: Position when slewing

  - before slewing to your target star, try having a near star selected. The more the CCD travels, the higher the likelyhood of missalignement
