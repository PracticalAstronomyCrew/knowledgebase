P04. Galaxy Cluster Mosaic
==========================

Observing Goals:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will observe a Galaxy Cluster and make a Mosaic by taking images at slightly different locations.
Useful Background and References:

Observation Planning:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * Target Selection

        * Find a large Galaxy Cluster that is above the horizon for the duration of the the observing night.

    * Observations

        * Read the "Creating a Mosaic" text under "Tools for observing".

Data Analysis:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * Data Reduction Basic Steps

        * Visit the page :ref:`data-reduction`
        * Make Dark sky flats to remove vignetting.
        * Remove the sky background by choosing locations with no objects.

    * Further for this project

        * Create a Mosaic 
        * Extract the sources from the Mosaic.

    * Further Analysis for this project

        * Try to find out if the galaxies are spirals or elipticals. 

Results:
^^^^^^^^

Can you answer these questions with your work?

    * Q1 Can you identify and quantify the stars and galaxies in your Mosaic?
    * Q2 
    * Q3 What is the ratio of spirals to elipticals as a function of the number density of galaxies.
