A3. Writing Good Scientific Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Notebook
********
The Jupyter notebook is laid out as a functional lab book, with text, explanations, external references, etc... added as appropriate. The notebook makes it clear how the work on the project was conducted. The notebook shows the data were handled with understanding, and the process of the project was well understood.

Style
*****
The code is well organized with a logical structure from ingesting raw data to science conclusions. Variable names are chosen sensibly. Functions are defined for repeated tasks (idententical code is not copy pasted). The code is commented where appropriate. The coding style is efficient and effective for the tasks at hand. The code can be understood by an outside reader.

Functionality
*************
The code runs from an arbritatry folder in the Jupyter hub. Any output files are saved in the working directory, or in a directory with the correct access permissions. The code works successfully after the installation of any required external packages. The code runs "unsupervised" from top to bottom on giving a "run all cells" command.

Outcomes
********
Plots / tables / other outcomes produced are labelled appropriately. If FITS files are saved, they have header information. Any files saved are named logically. Axes are labelled appropriately. Unites are included. Axes are plotted in the correct orientation (e.g. brightest at the top). Outcomes are clear to view, and are either saved or easy to save / export.

Science
*******
The scientific results produced by the code are reasonable and reliable. The code produces appropriate scientific results for the project. The code does not introduce errors into the results. The data are handled with understanding. Results are provided to answer the science questions related to the topic, and reasonable answers are found.

Here are some top tips on preparing scientific code for submission:
