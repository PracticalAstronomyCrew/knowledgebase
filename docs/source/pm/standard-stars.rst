R04: Standard Star Calibrations
===============================

If you have observed Standard Stars during your observing night, you can use these
observations to find a calibration to convert observed magnitudes at airmass :math:`X`:
:math:`m_X` to *True* magnitudes :math:`m_{\rm true}`. For details see the lecture
slides about **Photometry**, specifically slides about *Photometric Calibration*.

You can use the following notebook as a **starting point** to using the
observed standard star to calibrate your magnitudes.

The code uses the following csv file for the data on all the standard stars:
