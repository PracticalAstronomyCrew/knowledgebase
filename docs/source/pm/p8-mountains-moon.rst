P08. Mountains on the Moon
==========================

Observing Goals:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this project you will measure the height of mountains and other features on the Moon. To do this you will make use of a technique called "lucky imaging".
Useful Background and References:

    * For image stacking: https://www.autostakkert.com/
    * For identifying features on the Moon: Photographic Atlas of the Moon by Chong, Lim, and Ang Ebook via RUG Library
    * Moon Atlas: http://www.fullmoonatlas.com/
    * For locations of features: Chang'E-1 Topographic Atlas of the Moon by Li et al. Ebook via RUG Library

Observation Planning:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


    * Target Selection

        * You will make observations of the terminator line (between the day and night side of the Moon)

    * Observations

        * You will make observations using the internal guider camera (small rectangle)
        * For lucky imaging you will take many hundreds of images, to capture images where the atmospheric turbulence has less consequence

Data Ananlysis:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


    * Data Reduction Basic Steps

        *  Visit the page :ref:`data-reduction`


    * Further for this project

        * For each region that you consider, you can register and combine the images to measure precise coordinates
        * You can use AutoStakkert 2 to create "best" images for each region

    * Further Analysis for this project

        * You need to determine the Selenographic (= on the Moon) longnitude and latitude of the features you want to measure to within a degree (use the Chang'E Atlas)
        * Follow the Guide: Measuring Heights of Mountains from Shadows in the knoweldge base

Results: 
^^^^^^^^^

Can you answer these questions with your work?

    * Q1: What are the heights of at least 10 features on the surface of the Moon?
    * Q2: How do your results compare to those in the Chang'E Atlas, or from Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter data?
    * Q3: Bonus -- Look at data from previous years, and determine (and quantify) if this procedure is easier for some phases of the Moon than others.

Presenting your results:
